Hi!  
My name is Dmitry Figol. Currently I am a customer support engineer in Cisco TAC in Krakow. I enjoy networking a lot and I have CCIE R&S. On top of that I am Python and network programmability enthusiast. More information about me as well as contact details you can find on the [About](/about) page.

I've finally decided to start a blog to document and share some interesting findings. I am using Jekyll static site generator and so far I enjoy the workflow. All of the content is written in Markdown, which is super easy to work with.

This is my first post so expect things to change around here quite a lot, especially during the first month. Some links may be broken as well, but only temporarily.

Thanks for visiting my blog and I hope you will enjoy the content!   
Stay tuned!
